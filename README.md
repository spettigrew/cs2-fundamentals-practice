## Computer Science
### Computer Science Fundamentals
### Overview
During this sprint, we will introduce you to some fundamental Computer Science fundamentals. First, we will introduce you to Python (the language we will be using throughout Computer Science). Second, you will learn about Lambda's Problem-Solving Framework, which we call U.P.E.R. Third, you will learn about Big O notation and analyzing an algorithm's time and space complexity. Last, you will learn about the basics of computer memory.

All of these topics lay down a crucial base for the other three sprints in Computer Science. You will rely on your Python skills, problem-solving abilities, ability to analyze time and space complexity, and your mental model for computer memory throughout the rest of the course.

### Python Basics
In this module, you will learn all of the fundamentals of the Python programming language. After completing this module, you will have all the basics that you need to get started using Python to solve algorithmic code challenges and deepen your understanding and skill set related to programming.

### Problem Solving
In this module, you will learn about the U.P.E.R. Problem-Solving framework and best practices for asking for help. These skills are crucial as you encounter harder and harder code challenges in preparation for the technical interview process.

### Time and Space Complexity
This module will teach about mutability vs. immutability, time complexity analysis, and space complexity analysis. These topics are incredibly crucial for optimizing the algorithms that you write and ensuring that we prepare you for the technical interview process.

### Computer Memory Basics
This module will teach about RAM, number bases, fixed-width integers, how arrays are stored in memory, and character encoding. These basics allow you to better understand how other data structures are stored in memory and have an intuitive sense of the time complexity of specific data structures' operations.
